# Observer Pattern â€“ YouTube Channel Example

## Overview
The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.  
When one object (the Subject) changes state, all its dependents (Observers) are notified automatically.  
This pattern is widely used in event-driven systems.

##  Problem
In some systems, multiple components need to be updated whenever an object changes.  
Without the Observer pattern:
- You end up writing repetitive, tightly-coupled code.  
- Adding/removing listeners becomes complex.  
- The subject class grows messy with multiple responsibilities.

---

##  Solution
The Observer pattern solves this problem by:
- Encapsulating the publisher (Subject) and the subscribers (Observers) separately.  
- Delegating notification logic to the subject class.  
- Allowing observers to subscribe/unsubscribe dynamically at runtime.  
- Promoting loose coupling between sender and receivers.
