#  EI Smart Home & Design Patterns Project

This repository contains my Educational Initiative assignment with two major exercises:  

- Exercise 1: Java Design Pattern Demos  
- Exercise 2: Smart Home System Simulation  

The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Design Patterns, and real-world problem solving in Java using Maven structure.

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1 – Design Pattern Demos
- Behavioral:  
  - Observer – YouTube Channel & Subscribers  
  - Strategy – Payment Gateway (UPI, Credit, Debit)  

- Structural:  
  - Adapter – Smart AC (WiFi, Bluetooth)  
  - Proxy – Video Service (like Netflix with subscription checks)  

- Creational:  
  - Factory – Food Ordering System (Pizza, Burger, etc.)  
  - Singleton – Database Connection Manager  

Each pattern has its own README.md with:  
Overview →  Problem →  Solution → Example → Output

### Exercise 2 – Smart Home System
A menu-driven Java simulation of a Smart Home Hub that manages devices.

Features
- Add/remove devices dynamically (Light, Thermostat, Door Lock).  
- Turn devices on/off via Factory-created instances.  
- Automate actions with Schedules (time-based).  
- Add Triggers (event-based, e.g., temp > 25 → turn off light).  
- Apply Proxy for role-based access (admin vs guest).  
- Keep all devices updated via Observer pattern.
